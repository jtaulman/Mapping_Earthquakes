# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The goal for this analysis was to determine where all the earthquakes occured over the past 7 days. We were also tasked with seperating each earthquake by color and size based on the different magnitudes. This can all be seen on a world map that is overlayed with the tectonic plates.

### Results

The most earthquakes happen along the west coast of the United States and around the southern half of Alaska. Although that is the most common location for earthquakes, the biggest earthquakes tend ot occur throught Western Central and South America. There is also a high number of earthquakes near the Phillipines and Eastern China.

### Summary

Overall the most earthquakes occur on coastlines throughout the world where two or more tectonic plates meet. When looking at places to visit or move to, I would keep this in mind. Earthquakes are much more common on the areas shown on the map and should be though about when deciding to move or visit these locations.
